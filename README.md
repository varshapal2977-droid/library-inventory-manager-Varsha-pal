# Library Inventory Manager

A simple, beginner-friendly Library Management System built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
This project was created as part of the **Mini Project – Library Inventory Manager** assignment for the course *Programming for Problem Solving Using Python*.

##  Overview

This project helps manage a library’s collection of books using a command-line interface.  
It supports:

- Adding new books  
- Issuing books  
- Returning books  
- Viewing the complete book list  
- Searching by title  
- Saving inventory in a text file  
- Logging events and errors  

The system is fully menu-driven and uses OOP classes (`Book` and `LibraryInventory`) to keep the design clean and modular.
